                        <p class="tei-p2">1369. Subj: Facilities Negotiations. Ref: State 162871.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">1. Ambassador and EmbOff met with MinExtAff <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span> and Permanent Secretary Russell, pursuant
                            instructions reftel.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">2. Ambassador noted that he had fully reported <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> position on facilities talks conveyed by <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span> June 28 (Nassau 1177) and he
                            had now received instructions re response.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">3. Washington had expressed disappointment in departure from what we had
                            considered to be agreed context of negotiations, that U.S. facilities
                            and operating rights requirements would be considered in context of
                            specific security interests of both countries. In pre-independence
                            negotiations we had tried to make clear that quid pro quo for our
                            facilities and operating rights could not be related to general economic
                            assistance. U.S. now reaffirms this point.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">4. On assumption we had such an agreed context, U.S. sent technical
                            survey team to Nassau last September with Bahamian agreement to review
                            Bahamian security requirements with a view ultimately to determining
                            what U.S. contributions in this field might be agreed upon as
                            appropriate in connection with quid for facilities and operating <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve11p1/pg_1147" class="tei-pb1" id="pg_1147">[Page 1147]</a> rights. So far <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> has not commented on technical
                            survey team’s report.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">5. Ambassador said on question of operating rights we would find useful
                            an indication of which specific rights appear troublesome to <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span>, and would welcome a <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> counter-draft to ours.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">6. Ambassador went on to state Washington finds reduction in period of
                            agreement from 15 to 10 years not acceptable. Any shorter period would
                            make it necessary to consider alternative of a phase-out agreement. Key
                            date was 10 July 1988 and any period expiring prior to that would
                            require consideration of phase-out alternative. Ambassador also
                            clarified our AUTEC site requirements in accordance with para 6
                            reftel.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">7. Ambassador concluded by stating that we had basic conceptual problem
                            in connection with these negotiations and we must have a meeting of
                            minds before we can get very far on specifics. U.S. is prepared to
                            consider a package only in security context and not in wider economic
                            area. Unless we can achieve such an approach we would reluctantly be
                            forced to consider phase-out, a result which Ambassador believed would
                            not be in best interests of either side. In sum, continued use of U.S.
                            facilities must rest on agreement concerning a reasonable payment. We
                            would hope <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> would review its
                            position in light this U.S. response and, having rejected our
                            half-million-dollar-per-year payment offer, come up with a definitive
                            counter-offer.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">8. MinExtAff, after hearing Ambassador out, noted that he had not been a
                            participant in pre-independence talks but his recollection of record was
                            Bahamians had made clear all along their interest in economic assistance
                            which <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> considered part of
                            “security” problem since Bahamian security was very much a function of
                            its economic situation. As he recalled, U.S. had also spoken in terms of
                            economic elements of package, even though these somewhat vague and
                            required spelling out in subsequent negotiations. He admitted Bahamian
                            interest in survey report and in security assistance but only as one
                            element in overall package. He said he would review record of earlier
                            talks and get back to us, but thought that U.S. had a very bad case on
                            this point. Bahamian position has never varied.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">9. <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span> did not comment on
                            other elements Ambassador’s presentation except to note that <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> had thought 10-year period would be
                            acceptable to U.S. since present agreements were scheduled to conclude
                            in 1983.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">10. <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span> clearly had law of
                            the sea and <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> archipelago position
                            uppermost on his mind and spent rest of lengthy session dealing with
                            these issues, as reported in septel.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">11. <span class="tei-hi1 font-italic">Comment:</span>
                            <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span>’s comments make it clear
                            that in his view U.S. had never either sought to or made clear, and
                            Bahamians had <a href="https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve11p1/pg_1148" class="tei-pb1" id="pg_1148">[Page 1148]</a> never
                            accepted, idea that quid pro quo for our facilities and operating rights
                            package could not be related to economic assistance. We are sure that
                            when Bahamians come back to U.S. on this point they will attempt to show
                            that U.S. had viewed this as legitimate subject for consideration in
                            listing of quids during pre-independence discussions. Bahamians take a
                            much wider view of their “security” needs than simply fulfilling
                            technical survey report. Embassy believes that we should continue to
                            make points we have repeatedly made in past:</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">A. That for U.S. facilities question is pretty much a cost benefit
                            calculation and we are willing to pay Bahamians in form of rent some
                            figure up to what it would cost U.S. to relocate.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">B. Bahamas is too wealthy a country to qualify in competition with others
                            for U.S. economic assistance, and U.S. public and congressional views
                            today are increasingly less hospitable to economic assistance.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">C. There are many areas, particularly in transfer of U.S. expertise,
                            where U.S. can be helpful to Bahamas in very relevant ways, but these
                            should be specifically identified and considered on their own merits and
                            not be made part of a general quid pro quo package on bases.</p>
                        <p class="tei-p2">12. <span class="tei-gloss">Reftel</span>, as well as State 162871,
                            which arrived just as we were going into session with <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span>, do not in our judgment
                            accurately characterize pre-independence talks, either on Bahamian side
                            or ours, since we were prepared at that time to include economic quids,
                            and, as we see record, were viewed by Bahamians only as being “too
                            intangible” in the form they were put forward. This does not mean that
                                <span class="tei-gloss">GCOB</span> ever dismissed or rejected
                            idea of economic assistance, and opted for security assistance instead.
                            U.S. handling during tripartite independence talks may have been “deft
                            and firm” but we doubt it will be lasting. As final comment we would
                            like to call once more to Department’s attention inter-relationship
                            between how we fare in facilities talks and how we handle Bahamian
                                <span class="tei-gloss">LOS</span> concerns. They see a
                            relationship, whether it is explicit or not, and <span class="tei-persName">Adderley</span>’s subsequent jeremiad on this
                            issue indicates that way we handle <span class="tei-gloss">LOS</span>
                            issues can have definite backlash on how we come out on security talks.
                            Somebody up there better be putting these two together.</p>
